## Implementation Issues, Code Validation and Sanity Checks

- [x] check whether both versions (python & c++) explore the same set of nodes and in the same order (which they should) 
- [x] test c++ on Miller Schupp (load the dataset in c++) 
- [ ] add comments
- [x] fix file path handling
- [x] check python implementation (what informations do the nodes store in the heap? When does ACMove cut off branching?) 
- [ ] test insert moves algorithm
- [ ] fix data structure clearance in greedy_search

## Algorithm Improvements

- [ ] insert moves (ranking algorithm and implementation)
- [ ] m-transformations (ranking algorithm and implementation)
